This repository contains practical Data Science tasks completed during my internship at HighTech Software Solutions. It includes hands-on work such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and more. The goal is to apply real-world data science techniques using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and visualization libraries.
